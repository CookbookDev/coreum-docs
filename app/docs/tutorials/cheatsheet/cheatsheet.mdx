## Cheatsheet

- Coreum has three networks: `Mainnet`, `Testnet`, and `Devnet`.
- Each network has its own native token.
  The precision of the native token is 6 and the smallest fraction is called `denom`, and it has a `u` prefix, which stands for Micro(1e-6).
- For instance, in the `Mainnet` `1CORE is equal to 1_000_000ucore`, where:
- - `ucore` is a denom. An example of a denom is satoshi.
- - `CORE` is a display name of a token used mostly for UI purposes. An example of a display name is BTC.
- For the `Testnet` denom is `utestcore` and the display name is `TESTCORE`. Precision remains the same.
- For the `Devnet` denom is `udevcore` and the display name is `DEVCORE`. Precision remains the same.
- Pay attention, that all on-chain operations are made using subunits.
- You can run Devnet network on your local machine using [crust](https://github.com/CoreumFoundation/crust)
- You can get testnet/devnet tokens at the [faucet page](../tools-ecosystem/faucet.md)

### How to interact with the network
#### CLI
You should [install CLI client first](cored.md)

To target a specific network, you should export two environment variables for further use. For the testnet access do the following:
```bash
# CHAIN_ID we are going to use as a value for the --chain-id flag to target specific network
export CHAIN_ID="coreum-testnet-1"
# RPC_URL we are going to use as a value for the --node flag to target specific node within the given network
export RPC_URL="https://full-node.testnet-1.coreum.dev:26657"
```
\* If you want to use other network, find CHAIN_ID and RPC_URL values on the [network variables](network-variables.md) page.

You can run the next query to get the network status:
```bash
cored status # You can find the network ID and latest block height there
```

To see all available commands you can use `--help` flag.
```bash
cored --help
```
#### GRPC
You can find proto files [here](https://github.com/CoreumFoundation/coreum/tree/master/proto/coreum)

#### OpenAPI

OpenAPI is accessible at port `1317`. The host for the specific network can be found on the [network variables page](network-variables.md)

Testnet address is [https://full-node.testnet-1.coreum.dev:1317](https://full-node.testnet-1.coreum.dev:1317)
