# Faucet

You can fund your account here.

If you don't have an account, there are three ways to generate it:

-   (for all users) Go to [wallet](wallet.md) page, connect(install) wallet and create account
    there;
-   (for advanced users) Click `Generate Funded Wallet` button below;
-   (for advanced users) Or run `cored` CLI command:

```
export COREUM_CHAIN_ID="{Chain ID}"
cored keys add <name-of-the-key> --chain-id=$COREUM_CHAIN_ID
```

`{Chain ID}` depends on the Network, you can find value at
[network variables page](../tutorials/network-variables.md)

## Mainnet

You can generate your address at [wallet page](./wallet.md), and you can find the list of Coreum
Markets [here](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/coreum/markets/).

Note: Check if CEX supports withdrawal into Coreum Network beforehand.
